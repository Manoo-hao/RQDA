# RQDA

This repository so far only contains a single file which is an 
introductory (extensively annotated) R-script that you can use to 
install RQDA + dependencies + 
some helpful supplementary tools.

to give it a go, I would be very interested in the outcome, in 
particular if you are using a newer version of R.
